Why Languages ?
Computers do not understand human language, so people use programming languages to translate directions into binary code that devices can follow as apps, websites, and software programs.

Current active tasks (e.g., Zoom calls, games) reside in RAM.
Inactive files (e.g., photos, videos) are stored in SSD/HDD.
Opening an application moves it from SSD/HDD to RAM.

However, when we open an application that is statically installed on the computer by double-clickingÂ on it, it enters RAM. But what exactly enters RAM?
A machine's lowest level of understanding is limited to binary code (0/1).

Any final program that we run on our machine, like game that looks very fancy or a Chrome browser, in the end, what's running in the RAM is a bunch of numbers (0/1).

Cause RAM/OS doesn`t really understand programming languages, it only has like some sort of circuits, which can either be on(1) or off(0).

So how does this code get converted into 0 & 1 which is what goes into RAM?
